# Scheduling-by-Graph-coloring
The main aspect of this real world problem is that we can't visualise that complicated things like how to assign the different exam slots for the particular subject inorder to make a perfect schedule such that same student's different two subjects don't have the same slot of the same time.
We can think this way, how A University with so many fields and in the particular field there are many branches and also with each branch or each course there are many subjects so how can university create the Time table of Exams in the short time range of exam days without clashing of The same student's different courses at the same timing slot? we can't create that manually so This problem needs to be converted into the Computer algorithm inorder to create the optimum solution and this can be done using graph coloring algorithm of graph theory.
